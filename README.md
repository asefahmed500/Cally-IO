## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or another tunneling service (for testing Twilio webhooks locally)
- An Appwrite project
- A Google AI API Key
- A Twilio account with a purchased phone number

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. See `documentation.txt` for a complete list of required variables and their descriptions. Crucially, you must set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your public-facing URL for Twilio webhooks to work.

### 4. Appwrite Setup

To make the application fully functional, you must configure your Appwrite project with the required database collections and storage buckets. For a detailed, step-by-step guide on setting up the necessary attributes and permissions, please refer to the **Appwrite Setup** section in `/documentation.txt`.

### 5. Running the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you are testing the Twilio calling feature locally, you must expose your local server to the internet. Open another terminal and run:
```bash
ngrok http 9002
```
Copy the public HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and set it as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file.

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. To create your admin account, sign up using the email you specified in the `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable.
